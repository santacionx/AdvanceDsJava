DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING:
    optimal substructure(big problem depends on small problem)
    overlapping subproblems (repeat the subproblem)

PRIORITY QUEUE:
    MIN PRIORITY QUEUE
    MAX PRIORITY QUEUE
 OPERATION: INSERT, GET MIN/MAX, REMOVE MIN/MAX

 GRAPH:
  terminology: 
    .ADJACENT VERTICES
    .DEGREE
    .PATH
    .CONNECTED GRAPH
    .SUBGRAPH
    .CONNECTED COMPONENTS: *
    .TREE
    .FOREST
.SPANNING TREE:  CONNECTED GRAPH WHEN EDGE IS REMOVED:  NO CYCLE NO DISCONNECTED MIN EDGES.  *** 
.COMPLETE GRAPH : ALL VERTICES MUST HAVE DIRECT EDGE(NC2)N(N-1)/2. 
.TREE: MIN CONNECTED ACYCLIC GRAPH. EDGE(N-1)
